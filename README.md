# Journery
Journery is a journal app that keeps track of your journey in a world map. 


Countries that you have already visited will be painted in pink. You can click on a country to create a new post or view all previous posts. Editing and deleting the posts are also possible. The application keeps track of your user information, as well as persist sessions, so there is no need to worry about logging in every refresh of the page.
